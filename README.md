#Simon-say-code 🎮
<br>

A classic memory game built using html, css, javaScript and Readme.md — this is my first frontend project on GitHub and a foundational step in my web development journey.
<br>

##🧠 About the Game
Simon Says is a memory-based game where the user has to repeat an increasingly complex sequence of button presses shown by the game. This project recreates that logic using a clean UI and basic animations.
