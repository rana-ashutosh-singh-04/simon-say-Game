# Simon-say-code 🎮

A classic memory game built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and EJS — this is my first frontend project on GitHub and a foundational step in my web development journey.

## 🧠 About the Game

**Simon Says** is a memory-based game where the user has to repeat an increasingly complex sequence of button presses shown by the game. This project recreates that logic using a clean UI and basic animations.

## 🚀 Features

- Interactive Simon Says gameplay logic
- Visual feedback for button presses
- Level progression system

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
